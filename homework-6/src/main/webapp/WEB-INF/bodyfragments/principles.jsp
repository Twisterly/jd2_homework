<h1>Principles</h1>
<p>There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:<p>
<ol>
<li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
<li>It must be robust and secure.</li>
<li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
<li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
<li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>
</ol>
